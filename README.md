# Basic HTTP Server

### Description
This repo contains the files for an HTTP server (derived from a basic tcp server in *tcp-server/* )

### Why
To learn more about network programming and understand how protocols work.

## Run HTTP server
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build executables: `npm run build`
3. Run: `npm run start`

*You should then see the server listening on the loopback address and port because it's now listening.*

## Dev environment
*Run each of these in separate terminal sessions:*
### Recompile typescript files on change
`npm run watch`
### Execute program on file change
`npm run dev`
